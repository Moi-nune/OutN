## Usage

- requires [python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed

download the latest code by clicking on the code button and then the download zip button.

extract the folder and open a command prompt window in it

install dependencies using:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then run the program using:
```
python3 main.py
```
the program will ask for your bot token  and rare ping [role id](https://discordhelp.net/role-id) on initialisation
and then will save it to 'config.ini' so that it does not ask you every time it runs.

> [!NOTE]
> the token is only saved locally and is not sent anywhere.

> [!CAUTION]
> make sure not to upload 'config.ini' anywhere as it contains your bot token.
