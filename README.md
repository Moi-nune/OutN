## Usage

### automatic

just run run.bat by double clicking it
- it will install the dependencies and run the program for you in a venv(virtual environment) so as to not to mess with your python environment.

### manual

- requires [python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed

install dependencies using
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then run the program using
```
python3 main.py
```
the program will ask for your bot token on initialisation
and then will save it to 'config' so that it does not ask you every time it runs.

> [!NOTE]
> the token is only saved locally and is not sent anywhere.

> [!CAUTION]
> make sure not to upload 'config' anywhere as it contains your bot token.
